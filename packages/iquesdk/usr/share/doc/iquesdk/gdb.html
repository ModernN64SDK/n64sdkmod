<h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<p>The iQue Software Development Kit provides a debugging environment for
the iQue Player based on the <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/gdb.html">GNU Debugger (GDB)</a>.
 GDB is a command-line based source level debugger, but there are many <a
 href="#Usage%20GUI">graphical user interfaces</a> for it. The iQue Player
debugging environment is composed of two parts: the iQue Player GDB, <em>ique_gdb</em>,
running on the host machine and a GDB stub running on the iQue Player.  The
GDB stub is part of the iQue Player debug library, <b>libultra_d</b>, and
must be included in the program by the developer.  The GDB stub has to be
running on the iQue Player before the program can be debugged.  </p>
<p>The user of the debugger interacts with GDB, and GDB will communicate
the requests to the GDB stub on the iQue Player.  In order for the two components
to communicate, there is a third helper tool, <i>mux</i>, that takes the
input from GDB via a TCP socket and sends the information using RDB over
USB to the iQue Player.  Note that because GDB and <i>mux</i> communicate
via TCP, it is not necessary for GDB and <i>mux</i> to be on the same machine. 
 </p>
<p>The iQue Player debugger supports debugging the main CPU (i.e. the R4300
processor) of the iQue Player.  It allows the user to set breakpoints, step,
display registers, variables, and thread information for the main CPU.  The
debugger does not support debugging of the RCP (the graphics co-processor).
   <a name="Usage"></a>        </p>
<h3>Using the iQue Player debugger</h3>
  
<p>The iQue debugger is part of the iQue Software Development Kit.  Please
see the iQue SDK documentation for the system requirements and how to install
the iQue SDK.  The iQue debugger has been tested on RedHat Linux 9.0.
After installing the iQue SDK, the iQue
Player GDB program <i>ique_gdb</i> should be located in <i>$ROOT/usr/sbin</i>.
 The following two sections describe how to prepare an iQue player program
for debugging and how to use <em>ique_gdb</em> to debug the program.  <a
 name="Usage Preparation"></a> </p>
<h4>Preparing a program for debugging</h4>
   
<ul>
 <li>Create and start the GDB stub threads. 
    <p>To include the GDB stub in the program, the programmer should call
    <code>gdbInit()</code> to initialize and start the GDB stub threads.
     <br>
    <br>
   <b>GDB example</b>:   <code>
    <pre>    gdbInit();</pre>
    </code>   The call to <code>gdbInit</code> effectively starts a thread
with <code>gdbMain</code> as its entry point, a priority of <code>OS_PRIORITY_GDB</code>
and a thread ID of <code>OS_TID_GDBMAIN</code>.  The following code fragment
shows what <code>gdbInit()</code> does:    <code>
    <pre>    static OSThread gdbThread;<br>    static u64      gdbStack[GDB_STACKSIZE/sizeof(u64)] __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));<br>    osCreateThread(&amp;gdbThread, OS_TID_GDBMAIN, gdbMain, (void *)0,<br>                   (void *)(gdbStack + GDB_STACKSIZE/sizeof(u64)),(OSPri) OS_PRIORITY_GDB );<br>    osStartThread(&amp;gdbThread);</pre>
    </code>    For backward compatibility with a program written to be debugged
using RMON, creating a thread that calls <code>rmonMain</code> will create
threads for the GDB stub instead.      <br>
    <br>
   <b>RMON example</b> (deprecated):   <code>
    <pre>    static OSThread rmonThread;<br>    static u64      rmonStack[RMON_STACKSIZE/sizeof(u64)] __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));<br>    osCreateThread(&amp;rmonThread, OS_TID_RMONMAIN, rmonMain, (void *)0,<br>                   (void *)(rmonStack + RMON_STACKSIZE/8), (OSPri) OS_PRIORITY_RMON );<br>    osStartThread(&amp;rmonThread);</pre>
    </code>   </p>
  </li>
  <li>To distinguish between threads, give each thread an unique ID.  This
is not enforced by the OS, but unless every thread has an unique ID, it will
be difficult to determine which thread is which.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Restrict user thread priorities to the range 1 to 127 (OS_PRIORITY_APPMAX),
with 127 being the highest priority.  The idle thread must have a priority
of 0 (OS_PRIORITY_IDLE).  This is not enforced by the OS, but is necessary
for the debugger to function properly.  The debugger determines which threads
are user threads based on the priority, and if the thread priorities are
not set appropriately, the debugger may not function and may cause the system
to hang. 
    <p>Some possible scenarios are:   </p>
    <ul>
     <li>If the idle thread priority is not set to 0, the debugger will not
be able to identify which thread is the idle thread.  If the debugger suspends
the idle thread, the system will lock up.  To prevent this from happening,
the debugger will not suspend any user thread, but may not function correctly.</li>
     <li>If the user thread priority is too high, the debugger and USB threads
may never run.  It will be impossible to debug the program in that case.</li>
   
    </ul>
 </li>
  <br>
  <li>Compile a debug version and link with the libultra debugging library</li>
   
  <ul>
     <li>Use the <b>-g</b> option with <i>gcc</i> to compile a debug version
of the program</li>
     <li>Link with <b>libultra_d</b></li>
   
  </ul>
 
</ul>
   <a name="Usage Debugging"></a> 
<h4>Debugging your program</h4>
      Connect the USB cable between your linux host and the iQue player and
follow the steps below to start a debugging session with GDB: 
<ul>
 <li>Start <i>mux</i> on the host machine so that it is ready for GDB to
connect to it via TCP.  By default, <i>mux</i> will listen on TCP port 8088
for GDB debugger messages.  You can select a different port by using the
    <code>--debugport</code> option.</li>
 <li>Start the program to be debugged on the iQue Player.</li>
 <li>Start the GDB debugger on the host machine (or another machine that
has network connectivity to the host machine):   
    <ul>
     <li><code>      ique_gdb &lt;elf file&gt; <br>
     </code></li>
    
    </ul>
    See <a href="#Usage%20GUI">Graphical Front Ends to GDB</a> for how to
run <em>ique_gdb</em> with a GUI. </li>
 <li>Connect to the iQue Player from GDB via <i>mux</i>.<br>
     At the GDB prompt type <code>target remote &lt;machine name&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code>. 
    For instance, if <i>mux</i> and GDB are running on the same machine with
the default port:     
    <ul>
       <li>target remote localhost:8088     </li>
    </ul>
 </li>
 
</ul>
  Once GDB has attached to the target, all user threads will be stopped and
the program can now be debugged.  See the <a
 href="http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb_toc.html"> GDB
User Guide</a> for more information on how to use GDB.  When you are done
debugging, use the "<code>detach</code>" command to stop the GDB debugging
session and resume execution of the program.  If you want to leave the application
stopped so another debugger can connect to it, use the "<code>disconnect</code>"
command to disconnect from the iQue player.  Only one debugger can connect
to the iQue player at a time, so make sure that you've disconnected or detached
from the iQue player when you are finished debugging.  <a
 name="Usage GUI"></a> 
<h4>Graphical Front Ends to GDB</h4>
        For a visual debugging environment, there are several applications
that can supply a graphical front-end to GDB:   
<ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd"><b>DDD</b></a> (Data
Display Debugger)<br>
         <b>Note:</b> DDD does not display all the thread information that
the iQue Player provides.           Use the command <code>"info threads"</code>
in the gdb console window to get the full information.         
    <pre>Usage:   <code>ddd --debugger &lt;gdb&gt; &lt;elf file&gt;</code></pre>
         
    <pre>Example: <code>ddd --debugger "$ROOT/usr/sbin/ique_gdb" &lt;elf file&gt;</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://libre.act-europe.fr/gvd"><b>GVD</b></a> (GNU Visual
Debugger)<br>
         GVD is integrated into <a
 href="http://libre.act-europe.fr/gps/">GPS</a>         (GNAT Programming
System).<br>
             <b>Note:</b> Do not use the code disassembly feature in GVD.
 That does not work well with           the iQue Player.         
    <pre>Usage:   <code>gps --debugger=&lt;gdb&gt; --debug=&lt;elf file&gt;</code></pre>
         
    <pre>Example: <code>gps --debugger="$ROOT/usr/sbin/ique_gdb" --debug=&lt;elf file&gt;</code></pre>
      </li>
    
</ul>
  <a name="Limitations"></a> 
<h3>Limitations and Guidelines</h3>
 
<p>Because the iQue Player debugger runs in the same memory space as the
user program and relies on RDB/USB for communication with GDB, the iQue Player
debugger has several limitations in how it can be used.  These limitations
imply that the user must be very careful in how the debugger is used.  </p>
<p><b>When using the debugger, the following should be avoided:</b> </p>
<ul>
 <li>Never try to stop or step into the GDB stub threads or the USB threads.
 If you attempt to do this, and one of the GDB stub thread or USB thread
hits a break, then the debugger will cease to function.</li>
  
  <p>A summary of the system threads that you should not interfere with is
given below:

                 <br>
 </p>
  <li>Never try to stop, step into, or set breakpoints in the idle thread.
 If the idle thread stops, it will cause the entire system to lock up.</li>
 <br>
 <li>Never try to put a breakpoint in or step into an operating system function.
 Because the system functions are shared by GDB stub and the USB thread,
placing a breakpoint or stepping into these functions may also cause the
GDB stub thread or USB thread to stop, thus disabling the debugger.</li>
 <br>
 <li>Do not use watchpoints in GDB.  GDB uses software watchpoints that will
automatically set breakpoints in the running program and will very likely
set breakpoints in the GDB stub and USB threads, causing the debugger to
stop working.</li>
 <br>
 <li>Do not use <code>osSetEventMesg</code> to register message queues for
    <code>OS_EVENT_FAULT</code> or <code>OS_EVENT_CPU_BREAK</code>      events
if you want to use the GDB debugger.  Since only one message queue may be
associated with one event, the GDB stub will defer      to the user program
if the user program attempts to register messages queues for these events.
 This means that the GDB stub will not     get notified if there is a CPU
fault or a breakpoint.  If the GDB stub does not get notified of breakpoints,
you cannot use GDB     to set breakpoints and to step through your problem.
 If the GDB stub does not get notified of CPU faults, then GDB cannot inform 
    you when an CPU fault occurs.</li>
 
</ul>
  
<p><b>The debugger will not be able to debug all programs or problems.</b> 
</p>
<ul>
 <li>It cannot be used to debug problems with the RDB or USB since it relies
on these two components to function.</li>
 <br>
 <li>It is of limited use when debugging application startup.  Since the
GDB stub must be running before the program can be debugged, it is impossible
to debug anything that happens before that.   
    <p> To enable as much debugging of the start-up code as possible, the
developer should minimize the boot procedure and have the thread that is
started by the boot function do the following (in order):     </p>
    <ul>
       <li>Call <code>gdbInit()</code>. This will create and start the GDB
stub threads and allow the program to be debugged.</li>
       <li>Create but do not start the rest of the threads in the program.
 This will allow the program to start up in a stopped state.  The developer
can then attach to the program using GDB and start up the threads within
the debugger (by using the continue command).  This gives the developer a
chance to set breakpoints at the beginning of the thread and to watch the
startup of the thread.</li>
       <li>Lower the priority of the thread to 0 and have it become the idle
thread.</li>
    
    </ul>
 </li>
 <br>
 <li>Because the debugger changes the timing of the application and the scheduling
of the threads, the debugger is also of limited use when debugging multithreaded
problems (i.e. deadlock, race conditions, etc).</li>
 <br>
 <li>Since the software program and the debug support are all in the same
memory space, it is possible for a bug (i.e. buffer overflow) in the software
program to stomp over the GDB stub. Once that happens, the debugger will
not be of use any longer.</li>
 
</ul>
  
<p><b>The following are not supported by the iQue Player debugger:</b> </p>
<ul>
   <li>Debugging the Reality Coprocessor.</li>
   <li>Watchpoints and tracepoints.</li>
   <li>Sending signals to the iQue Player.</li>
   <li>Scheduler locking.</li>
</ul>
  <a name="Issues"></a> 
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
 
<ol>
    <li>When attaching to the iQue player, <em>ique_gdb</em> gives following warning:
        <blockquote><code>
        warning: shared library handler failed to enable breakpoint
        </code></blockquote>
        This message appears to be harmless and should not interfere with 
        the functionality of the debugger.</li>
    <li>If the PC is invalid (e.g. by trying to jump to an invalid function
pointer), then        the stack backtrace is unavailable.       <em>ique_gdb</em>
is based on GDB 6.0 and there appears to be a problem with GDB 6.0 frames
support for the MIPS processor.  Once GDB 6.1 becomes available, we will
check whether the new version fixes the problem.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The iQue Player can get into a state where it stops communicating
with the <em>ique_gdb</em> program.  If you encounter this, restart the application,
    <em>ique_gdb</em>, <em>mux</em> and try again.</li>
    <br>
    <li>If more than one GDB tries to connect to the iQue player, the second
GDB will just hang.  Only one GDB can connect to the iQue Player at a time.
 Do not try to use multiple GDBs at the same time.</li>
    <br>
    <li>If multiple threads are faulted or stopped due to different causes,
only one cause can be reported back to GDB.  The GDB Remote Serial Protocol
only allows for one signal to be sent to GDB when the program stops.</li>
